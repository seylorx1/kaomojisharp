### Kaomojis in your code!
To use KaomojiSharp, simply search for "KaomojiSharp" in the NuGet package manager or, alternatively, you can browse through this repository's packages [here](https://github.com/seylorx1/kaomojisharp/packages/).

#### How do I use KaomojiSharp in my code?

KaomojiSharp is (or at least should be) .NET 2.0 compliant and is an incredibly small library.

> The library is documented in Visual Studio's Intellisense. A code example implementing KaomojiSharp can be found in the [example](https://github.com/seylorx1/kaomojisharp/tree/example) branch. I'll begin development on better documentation once I find time to do so; this really is a small library at this point so what you see with Intellisense is *pretty much* all you get.
